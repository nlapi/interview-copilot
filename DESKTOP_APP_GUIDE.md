## Special Desktop Features

### Hiding the Application During Interviews

Interview Copilot provides several ways to hide the application during your interviews:

#### Keyboard Shortcut
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to instantly hide/show the window.
- This is the recommended method for quickly toggling visibility during an interview.

#### System Tray
- The application runs in the system tray even when the main window is hidden.
- Right-click the tray icon and select "Show/Hide App" to toggle visibility.
- Double-click the tray icon to toggle visibility.

#### Stealth Mode
- Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` to toggle "Stealth Mode" which dims the application's appearance.
- This makes the application less noticeable without completely hiding it.

### Automatic Screen Sharing Detection

Interview Copilot has a built-in feature that automatically hides the application when screen sharing is detected, to prevent interviewers from seeing that you're using assistance.

- When screen sharing starts, the app will automatically hide.
- When screen sharing ends, the app will become visible again.
- You will see notifications when screen sharing is detected and when it ends.

## Tips for Using During Interviews

1. **Prepare Before the Interview**:
   - Enter your API key and configure settings before the interview starts.
   - Test that everything works by doing a quick recording test.

2. **Quick Access**:
   - Remember the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+I` to quickly hide/show the app.
   - Use the tray icon as a fallback method for controlling visibility.

3. **Positioning**:
   - Position the Interview Copilot window on a second monitor if available.
   - Otherwise, position it at the side of your screen where you can easily see it.

4. **Use Manual Input for Complex Questions**:
   - For complex technical questions, use the manual input feature to paste the question rather than speaking it.
   - This ensures accurate transcription of technical terms and code.

5. **Be Discreet**:
   - Keep the window hidden when not actively using it.
   - Use the app during breaks or when given time to work on a problem.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the desktop application:

1. **App Not Responding**:
   - Try closing and reopening the application.
   - Check the system tray to ensure the application is not running in the background.

2. **Microphone Issues**:
   - Ensure your microphone is properly connected and selected in your system settings.
   - Make sure you've granted microphone permissions to the application.

3. **Window Stuck Hidden**:
   - Use the system tray icon to show the window again.
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` to toggle visibility.
   - If all else fails, restart the application.

4. **Transcription Problems**:
   - If speech recognition doesn't work well, try using the manual input feature instead.
   - Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits.
